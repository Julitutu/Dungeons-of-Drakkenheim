			<p class="indent"><b><i>Inverse Kneecaps.</i></b> Your legs become more powerful, and your knees now bend the opposite direction. While in this form, you increase your walking speed by 10 feet, and you can double your long and high jump distance.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Aquatic Attributes.</i></b> You grow gills and your skin becomes slimy, the flesh between your fingers and toes becomes webbed. While in this form, you can breathe underwater, and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Natural Weapons.</i></b> You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. You can use your Charisma modifier for attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">The damage of your unarmed strikes increases as you gain levels in this class: 2d6 damage beginning at 10th level, and 3d6 damage at 14th level.</p>

			<p>When you choose your reshaped form, you can choose any two options available to you.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Gelatin Bones.</i></b> Your skin looks loose and saggy as you struggle to maintain your structure. You can now fit into spaces as small as one inch in diameter and gain advantage on Stealth checks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Change Appearance.</i></b> You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same. For example, if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Combat Instincts.</i></b> You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. In addition, your natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spider Claws.</i></b> Your hands and feet grow strange mucusslicked insectoid features that allow you to climb surfaces. You gain a climb speed equal to your walk speed and can stick to ceilings as well without needing to make an ability check.</p>
