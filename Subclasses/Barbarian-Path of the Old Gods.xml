			<p>These barbarians consider themselves natural weapons, born of the gods to stand against the enemies of their chosen deity. The Old Gods represent raw power, the untamed wild, and traditional worship. A barbarian who follows the Old Gods is often close to nature, and sees glorious battle as the arena of their gods, and their purpose is to destroy the enemies of their chosen god.</p>
