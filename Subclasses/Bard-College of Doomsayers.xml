			<p>Bards of this college revel in the fear and despair of others. They have foreseen the end of times, and use their gifts of prophecy to instill terror in those who hear their words. These bards command an audience like any other, but their craft is that of a mad prophet, and their poems and songs echo dissonant rattlings of hopelessness and suffering. Those who hear the mad ramblings are stricken with fear, lose their wills, and fall into madness.</p>

			<p>As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target takes psychic damage equal to the roll of your Bardic inspiration die and must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the target becomes frightened of you until the start of your next turn.</p>

			<p>You can behold glimpses of the most disastrous outcome for every possible action. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you use your reaction and attempt to make these visions come true. The triggering creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the triggering attack roll misses or the triggering ability check or saving throw fails. On a successful saving throw, the creature makes the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw normally, and you do not expend your use of this ability. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
