			<p>Whenever someone has something of value, usually illegal, that they need delivered discreetly, they call a smuggler. These rogues are experts at concealing, stealing, and blending in unnoticed to the common folk. They are also uniquely skilled at turning opportunities around when things are not going their way, and using whatever means necessary to achieve their goals. These slippery rogues are crafty and cunning and should not be underestimated.</p>

			<p>You gain proficiency with the disguise kit, land vehicles, and water vehicles.</p>
			<p>Whenever you make an ability check related to smuggling or concealing objects you add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>
			<p>If you are driving a wagon, boat, or other vehicle with which you are proficient, you know tricks and modifications that you can make to build simple smuggler compartments in almost any vehicle. After one hour of work, you can conceal up to one-quarter of the maximum carrying capacity of the vehicle at the Game Master’s discretion. It takes one hour of work to modify a Large or smaller vehicle, eight hours to modify a huge vehicle, and two days to modify a Gargantuan or larger vehicle.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 17th level, you can store spells cast by other creatures in your bag. Your bag can store up to 6 levels worth of spells at a time.</p>
			<p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into your bag by touching the bag as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in your bag. If your bag can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can place a spell scroll in the bag. The spell is cast and stored in your bag and the spell scroll is destroyed.</p>
			<p>You can cast any spell stored in your bag. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the bag is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>
