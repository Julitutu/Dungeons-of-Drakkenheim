		<description>
			<p>You take on an otherworldly cosmic appearance or essence. Choose one or more of the attributes listed below, decide your own, or roll randomly to determine how the cosmic powers bestowed into you take form.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your eyes become pools of inky black with small galaxies floating within them. To look into them is as if floating through the cosmos lost in the void of space.</li>
				<li>Your touch becomes cold as ice and your skin becomes pale. Some might think you undead or sickly. You appear as if you had died in the cold of space.</li>
				<li>Your voice has a slight echoing nature to it. As if there is more than one entity speaking through you. Your own voice is most prominent but when listening carefully one can make out a chorus of celestial voices speaking through you.</li>
				<li>You give off a faint smell of ozone — acrid and sulfuric, as if lightning had just struck nearby. It seems unnatural and otherworldly.</li>
				<li>You develop a third eye in the middle of your forehead that is unblinking, and seems to pierce into people’s minds as it stares upon them.</li>
				<li>Your veins glow with a soft radiant light, giving you the appearance of a walking constellation of stars and cosmic energy.</li>

			<p>Once per turn when you miss a creature with eldritch blast, the beam returns to you as an orbiting comet around your head. While you have an orbiting comet, you can absorb its energy to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Cosmic Power.</b> Once on your turn when you cast eldritch blast, you can consume one orbiting comet to fire an additional beam.</li>
				<li><b>Interception.</b> You can use your reaction to intercept a melee or ranged attack, gaining resistance to the damage from that attack.</li>
				<li><b>Lightspeed.</b> As a bonus action, you can consume a comet to teleport 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can have a maximum number of orbiting comets equal to your proficiency bonus. As long as you have comets, you glow with bright light out to 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The comets last until you finish a short or long rest, or until you dismiss them (no action required).</p>
