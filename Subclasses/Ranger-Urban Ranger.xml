			<p>Urban rangers are less accustomed to nature and the wilds, but to the rooftops and guerilla tactics of city warfare. Training for maneuverability and stealth amongst ruined buildings, and twisting streets, these rangers are at home amongst the ruins and rubble. They are agile runners, skilled snipers, and always able to know where the best vantage points against their enemies are.</p>
