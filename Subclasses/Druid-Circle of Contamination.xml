			<p>As druids are often in tune with nature and the natural order, most see delerium as a scourge upon the world. However, a rare few see the truth: the eldritch stones are an essential part of the natural order, one which works at a cosmic scale. Druids of the Circle of Contamination use the blighted rocks and contaminating Haze as a conduit for supernatural evolution. They have embraced the chaotic power of Delerium as an extension of the inherent chaos in the natural order, spreading the Haze while wielding it as a powerful ally to fuel their spells.</p>

			<p>Your magic becomes a twisted mockery of druidic principles, and you can twist your spells to suit your needs. Your spells which conjure creatures or natural flora and fauna now appear like sickly, fleshy tentacles, and animals you summon are cancerous and mutated. In addition, when you cast a spell, you can choose one of the following blighted magic options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Twin Spell.</b> If the spell you cast targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to target a second creature in range with the same spell. To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level.</li>
				<li><b>Quicken Spell.</b> When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the spell as a bonus action.</li>
				<li><b>Corrupt Spell.</b> When you roll damage for a spell, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to change the damage type of all damage caused by the spell to necrotic. In addition, you can reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one). You must use the new rolls.</li>
				<li><b>Purify Spell.</b> When you cast a contaminated spell (found in Chapter 4), you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the spell without gaining a Contamination Level.</li>

You can cast the purge contamination* spell as an action without expending a spell slot. You don’t need to provide the material components when you cast the spell in this way, and the target does not gain any exhaustion levels from this casting of the spell. When you cast purge contamination* in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
