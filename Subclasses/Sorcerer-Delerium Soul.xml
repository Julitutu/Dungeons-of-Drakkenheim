			<p>When you cast a contaminated spell, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, you don’t gain a Contamination Level by casting the spell, and if the spell requires delerium as a material component, it is not consumed by the spell. In addition, casting a contaminated spell in this manner immediately causes an Arcane Anomaly (see page 233).</p>

			<p>You can tap into contaminated energy to cast a spell you do not know. You can cast any spell from any class spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and you must expend a spell slot as normal. Casting the spell uses the spell’s normal casting time, and if the spell has material components, you must provide those components as normal. As part of casting the spell, but before the spell takes effect, you gain a number of Contamination Levels equal to half the spell’s level, rounded down (minimum of one). You can’t prevent or reduce these Contamination Levels by any means, but you can remove them as normal.</p>
