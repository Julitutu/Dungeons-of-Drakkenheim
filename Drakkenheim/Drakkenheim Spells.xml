			<p><i>When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.</i></p>
			<p>This spell transforms a willing creature that you touch into a horrific monstrosity. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.</p>
			<p class="indent">The new form can be an aberration with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen aberration. It retains its alignment and personality.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition to a delerium fragment worth 100gp, you must provide either the heart or brain (or equivalent organ in the case of aberrations with a truly alien physiology) taken from a creature of the same type: the organ must either be recently harvested or magically preserved via gentle repose or similar magic. As part of casting the spell, you drive the delerium fragment into the organ, and both are consumed by the spell. The Game Master determines if an aberration’s physiology makes its organs suitable for use with this spell.</p>

			<p><i>When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.</i></p>
			<p>You create two Large hands of shimmering, octarine force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hands last for the spell’s duration. Both hands move at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hands.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If one or both of the hands drop to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Each hand has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0) and occupies its space.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast the spell, and as an action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hands up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with each. Both hands can perform the same action, or different ones. The two hands must move to remain within 30 feet of each other.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Arcane Slam.</i></b> The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 necrotic damage. If you direct both hands to attack the same target, they gain advantage on the attack roll.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Forceful Throw.</i></b> The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. If both hands are used against the same target, you can throw them ten times your spellcasting ability modifier, and gain advantage on the check against a Large or smaller target.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Eldritch Grip.</i></b> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If both the hands are used against the same target, they can grapple a creature regardless of its size, and you have advantage on the grapple check against a Large or smaller target.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Contaminated Crush.</i></b> You can have a hand crush a target it is grappling. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Contamination Level.</p>
			<p class="indent">If both the hands are grappling the same target, you can have them rip the grappled target limb from limb. They deal an extra 4d12 necrotic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the arcane slam and contaminated crush options increases by 2d12 and the damage from the eldritch grip increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

		<supports>Apothecary, Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, Spell Saving Throw</supports>
		<description>
			<p><i>When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.</i></p>
			<p>This spell allows you to control gravity in a 100-foot-cube centered on a point within range. When you cast this spell and at the start of each of your turns for the spell’s duration, you decide which direction gravity pulls within the area. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall in the direction you choose until they reach the edge of the area. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.</p>
			<p class="indent">If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the edge of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can decide to prevent gravity from acting within the area. When you do, creatures within the area levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.</p>

		<description>
			<p><i>When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.</i></p>
			<p>You banish a creature that you can see within range into the Space Between Worlds. Upon this roiling plane of chaotic potential, the target wanders incomprehensible vistas searching for a way back via strange and absurd exits. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes an Intelligence check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends. On a failed check, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
			<p class="indent">Time passes differently for the target within the Space Between Worlds, and it perceives its time spent there as having lasted hundreds or perhaps thousands of years, even if it was only gone for rounds or minutes in the mortal world.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature which dies in the Space Between Worlds does not return.</p>

A creature takes 10d6 radiant damage, 10d6 necrotic damage, 10d6 thunder damage, 10d6 psychic damage, and 10d6 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

			<p class="indent">The falling stars leave lasting contamination in the areas they affect, which lasts for one hour.
