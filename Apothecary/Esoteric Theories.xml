You decide what the creature looks like, including facial features, he sound of its voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, but none of its game statistics change. You can’t alter the size of a creature, and its basic shape stays the same. The resulting transformation is non-magical, however, a greater restoration spell or similar magic cast upon the creature can restore it to its original appearance.</p>
