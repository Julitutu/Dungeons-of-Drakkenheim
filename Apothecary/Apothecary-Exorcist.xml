			<p>An Exorcist comes prepared to deal with evil entities, sinister spirits, and fearsome fiends. Equipped with their holy symbol, a book of prayers, and a bag of ritualistic baubles, they stand ready to face the most unnatural and otherworldly entities of the realms. An Exorcist is accustomed to facing down insurmountable threats, with a holy symbol in hand they fear nothing, and stand as a shield between the realms of men, and those of monsters.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level you gain the ability to imbue divine energy through your holy symbol to expel evil entities in the area, or purge their harmful effects from your allies.</p>
			<p>When you use this feature, you choose which effect to create. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus rounded down, you regain all expended uses on a short or long rest.</p>
			<p>If an Exorcism effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals your Apothecary spell save DC.</p>
			<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead or fiend fails its saving throw against your Expel Evil feature, that creature suffers 4d8 radiant damage.</p>
			<p><b>Expel Evil.</b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring creatures that mean you harm. Each undead, celestial, fey, or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
			<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
			<p><b>Purge Corruption.</b> You touch a creature or item and can end either one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. Additionally, if a creature is possessed or mind controlled by a spirit or foreign entity, you can use this feature to remove any traits or other features related to the possession. If possessed, the creature possessing it is shunted out of its host to an unoccupied space within 5 feet and takes psychic damage equal to 2d8 + your apothecary level.</p>
