			<p>The study of diseases opens doorways to many dangerous scientific discoveries. As experts in both ridding the body of sickness and the mutations of infectious disease, Pathogenists bring their study to the battlefield by using monsters and enemies as test subjects for their infections. Long years spent carefully monitoring the causes and effects of such plagues allows them to be experts at disease mutation, allowing their sickness to spread in a terrifying manner and riddle their foes with debilitating symptoms, crippling their bodies and rattling their minds.</p>
