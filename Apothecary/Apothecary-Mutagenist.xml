			<p>As a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot to undergo a grotesque transformation. The transformation ends after one minute, or if you are reduced to 0 hit points or incapacitated. When you undergo this transformation you maintain your personality, alignment, and game statistics. However, several changes occur:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your Strength and Intelligence ability scores are swapped.</li>
				<li>Your size becomes Large, your jump distance is doubled, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</li>
				<li>Each of your hands transform into a big meaty fist, which you can use to make melee weapon attacks. It counts as a simple weapon for you. Your big meaty fists deal 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your Apothecary level bludgeoning damage on a hit.</li>
				<li>You cannot cast or concentrate on spells.</li>
				<li>You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</li>
				<li>You gain temporary hit points equal to five times your Apothecary level.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You also amplify your abilities based on the potency of your concoction. This is related to the spell slot you used to undergo the transformation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your speed increases by 5 feet per level of spell slot used.</li>
				<li>Your AC is 13 + the level of spell slot used.</li>
				<li>At the start of each of your turns and as long as you have at least 1 hit point remaining, you regain a number of hit points equal to the level of the spell slot used.</li>
